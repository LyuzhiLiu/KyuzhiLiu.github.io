### CPSC 120

* **Lab 7**: Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt.
* **Lab 1**: Lab 1 was another favorite because it allowed me to explore how should I start my coding part. And this is also my first time for coding.
* **Lab 3**: Lab 3 was enjoyable because that my first time do a big coding part by myself, even it's hard, but I still did it!
